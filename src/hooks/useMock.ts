      summary: `Many discussions in the NFT space have been revolving around fine arts and music, making us forget about bigger, even more exciting use cases for this technology: financial NFTs. While this idea has been floating around, so far it's been too complicated to implement. As we are exploring a variety of derivatives and working on the perpetual polarized options, we are excited to launch another line of product for antimatter: non-fungible finance.`,
      details: `This product allows people to trade indexes in NFT format with a variety of underlying assets combination. Anyone can create indexes in a permission-less way. To create your index, you simply need to define the type of underlying crypto asset with amount. Then you can release the index to public.
Anyone can buy or sell these indexes. When you buy an index, the contract will automatically purchase underlying assets from the market and then generate the NFT index for buyer. To sell the index, the seller will burn his piece of NFT index and liquidate the underlying asset. NFTs can be used as a locker for crypto assets. Use cases include digital safe with an unlock schedule, or gift that you can reward to people. You can select asset to put into a locker NFT and you can choose a release schedule for the token.
